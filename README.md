This project demonstrates a robust authentication system that handles user sessions by securely hashing passwords, generating session tokens, and storing session data in PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM. The server is containerized using Docker for consistent environments across development and production. Itâ€™s a great starting point for building scalable and secure user authentication in Node.js applications.

Key Features
1. Secure password hashing with crypto module
2. Session management using tokens
3. PostgreSQL database integration with Drizzle ORM
4. Dockerized environment for deployment
5. RESTful API structure with Express.js
